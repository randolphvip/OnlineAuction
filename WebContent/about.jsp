					Charity Second-hand Online Store is a small shop which sell a variety of items donated by the public and the money made helps that charity to continue its valuable work. The charity store is usually run by volunteers, people giving their time voluntarily to help the charity. Shopping in the charity store has many benefits, for the charity, and for the shopper! <br>

					Firstly, items sold in the charity store are generally a lot cheaper than in high street stores. Yes, this is because they are used, but, only really good quality items get put out to sell to the public. You can always find a bargain in the charity store, from a new top to a pair of shoes, a handbag to a piece of jewellery.<br>

					Secondly, if the charity shop has a lot of donations coming in, we generally change the stock on a daily basis, which means that there is always a variety of items to choose from. <br>

					Thirdly, you can find interesting treasures in the charity store. Especially when it comes to bric-a-brac items.<br> 

					Finally, knowing that the money you are spending in the charity store is going to a good cause is a great reason to shop there. There are many charities which rely on charity shops to fund what they do. <br>

					We would recommend shopping in the charity store, even very occasionally, because you never know how big a difference buying one small thing might make!</p>
